    <h1>Bobo Yuan, confess your crimes! 💀</h1>
	<h3 style="margin-top: -32px;">with evidence.</h3>
    <h2>A response to Bobo's website:</h2>
    <a href="http://124.47.0.106/" style="margin-top: -16px;">Bobo's nonsense website link</a>
	<div style="margin: 256px"></div>

	<h2>Preamble</h2>
	<h3>Yuan Bobo (“Yuan Bobo”), has assembled his website (“Website”), accusing me (“I”) of being homosexual (“Gay”) with Arthur.</h3>
	<h3>His website has contained several accusations that falsely stated that I am in a homosexual relationship with a classmate Arthur,</h3>
	<h3>which is deceitful, as he provided no evidence, nor any witnesses to validate his claims.</h3>
	<div style="margin: 16px;"></div>
	<h3>This website is for destroying Bobo's claims, while proving what is right and wrong, with 'evidence-based' claims.</h3>

	<h2 style="margin: 64px;">Response to "The GAY incident":</h2>
	<h3>By looking at the website’s (“http://124.47.0.106/”) first false claim, Yuan Bobo states</h3>
	<h3>that I “took advantage of our friendship to steal and forge evidence claiming that I’m (Yuan Bobo) gay.”</h3>
	<h3>He also mentioned that I knew it was a joke and went on to spread the misinformation.</h3>
	<div style="margin: 16px;"></div>
	<h3>Paul K. McKenna mentions this a lot: “The first time is a mistake, the second time is a decision, and the third time is a habit.”</h3>

	<h5>(10 Evidences from the Discord group chat ("No one meiyou qian"))</h5>
	<h3 style="margin-top:64px;">As we can already see, Yuan Bobo has ‘clearly’ said that he somewhat has homosexual feelings</h3>
	<h3>towards me. Although Yuan Bobo thought this was a ‘joke’, expressing his feelings towards a male person</h3>
	<h3>towards the same person, in the same group chat, with the same intentions, states that this is not</h3>
	<h3>a joke at this point and should be considered as that he is indeed gay.</h3>
	<div style="margin: 16px;"></div>
	<h4>“There’s only one possibility: it’s to cover up the fact that James Park</h4>
	<h4 style="margin-top:-16px;">is gay and involved with Arthur. This is unforgivable!!!”</h4>
	<h5 style="margin-top:-16px;">An extract from the website.</h5>
	<div style="margin: 16px;"></div>
	<h3>His website states that there’s only one possibility where I accuse him of being gay, with it being</h3>
	<h3>the fact that I’m trying to cover up the fact that I’m gay. However, looking at his website, there is</h3>
	<h3>no direct evidence shown in his website that clearly states that I’m gay.</h3>
	<div style="margin: 16px;"></div>
	<h3>Plus, as I mentioned earlier, the first might be a joke, but the second, and third? It’s not.</h3>
	<div style="margin: 16px;"></div>
	<h3>This means that if Yuan Bobo wanted to make a comeback, he would need at least two more</h3>
	<h3>pieces of evidence to support his claim, plus he would need to invite people to the group chat if he wanted to prove his evidence.</h3>
	<div style="margin: 16px;"></div>
	<h5>If you are wondering if my pieces of evidence are real, please DM wndx2 on Discord, and I will add you to the group chat.</h5>

	<h2 style="margin: 64px;">Response to "The Genshin Impact Incident":</h2>
	<h3>In response to his second false claim of the “Genshin Incident”, again, he has no evidence, nor any</h3>
	<h3>witnesses to prove that he does not play Genshin. He stated,</h3>

	<h4>“At school and on Discord, I’ve been falsely accused multiple times of having played Genshin</h4>
	<h4 style="margin-top:-16px;">Impact, all of which started from nothing more than a joke.”</h4>
	<h5 style="margin-top:-16px;">An extract from the website.</h5>

	<h3>Firstly, and most importantly, he has no evidence to support his arguments, and without even</h3>
	<h3>having a witness, he could not prove that his arguments are true.</h3>
	<div style="margin: 16px;"></div>
	<h3>However, while I do not have any evidence, there are people (Arthur, for example,) who have</h3>
	<h3>witnessed the scene where Yuan Bobo has directly said that his Discord nickname “huile” is from</h3>
	<h3>his friend wanting him to play Genshin Impact, during a conversation where we were talking about people’s nicknames.</h3>
	<div style="margin: 16px;"></div>
	<h3>Secondly, during week 6, people witnessed Yuan Bobo’s screen, where the game Genshin Impact</h3>
	<h3>was downloaded in the past, as his iOS App Store, on the Genshin Impact page, has displayed a</h3>
	<h3>cloud icon, with an arrow pointing downwards. If you have used iOS, or MacOS before, you’d know</h3>
	<h3>that the app was downloaded before, but if you haven’t used it before, basically in the iOS App</h3>
	<h3>Store, if you have downloaded an app in the past, the App Store keeps track of your downloads,</h3>
	<h3>and displays the icon (mentioned before), instead of a blue button saying “Get”.</h3>
	<div style="margin: 16px;"></div>
	<h5>This is still on his app store; If you ask Bobo to open the App Store, and tell him to open Genshin Impact,</h5>
	<h5 style="margin-top:-16px">he would be scared to death 💀</h5>
	<div style="margin: 16px;"></div>
	<h3>Lastly, during his school days, his friend Arthur witnessed a ‘CLEAR’ moment when Yuan Bobo</h3>
	<h3>tried to download Genshin Impact on his laptop, by searching “Genshin Impact for MacBook”, on the internet.</h3>
	<div style="margin: 16px;"></div>
	<h3>Additionally, his website states that my accusing Yuan Bobo of playing Genshin is just a cover-up</h3>
	<h3>for the fact that I play Blue Archive, and without even a piece of proper evidence or a witness, he</h3>
	<h3>cannot back his point on his website that I play Blue Archive.</h3>
	<div style="margin: 16px;"></div>
	<h3>Furthermore, there was a scene where I recognised a character from the game Blue Archive,</h3>
	<h3>where from then, Yuan Bobo has created this nonsense to back his points. However, knowing a</h3>
	<h3>single character from a game does not mean that an individual plays that game. If you need a </h3>
	<h3>comparison, it’s like saying you play Honkai Star Rail, just because you know the name of the game</h3>

	<h2 style="margin: 64px;">Response to "The Lemon Incident":</h2>
	<h3>As a reply to the “Lemon Incident”, it is true that I have released the LemonBot to the public,</h3>
	<h3>where users could earn lemons (virtual currencies), and spend them.</h3>
	<h4>“However, roughly a week after Lemon’s release, development on its economic reset system was abruptly discontinued.”</h4>
	<h5 style="margin-top:-16px;">An extract from the website.</h5>

	<h3>To back my claims, this is again not true. The LemonBot’s development was indeed not abruptly</h3>
	<h3>discontinued but was ‘stopped’, due to my more urgent studies compared to the bot development.</h3>
	<div style="margin: 16px;"></div>
	<h3>There is a difference between ‘discontinue’, and ‘stop’, where discontinue means to stop</h3>
	<h3>something permanently (in most cases), while stop means to stop something temporarily; and </h3>
	<h3>since the full context wasn't given, I can assume that he was meaning ‘stop forever’ when Yuan </h3>
	<h3>Bobo meant to discontinue, which is not true, as I did start developing right after the tests ended.</h3>

	<h4>“... and after I lost all my Lemons in bets, he mocked me.”</h4>
	<h5 style="margin-top:-16px;">An extract from the website.</h5>

	<h3>Think about this, this is a ‘virtual currency’, where lemons hold no monetary value in real life. This</h3>
	<h3>means that the currency ‘lemons’ is just a number in the system that means nothing if you think </h3>
	<h3>critically about this. Again, think about this: When someone loses all their ‘virtual currency’ while </h3>
	<h3>betting, who wouldn’t laugh?</h3>

	<h4>“To make things worse, he stole my 2088 Lemons! This is nothing short of robbery!!! 😠 ”</h4>
	<h5 style="margin-top:-16px;">An extract from the website.</h5>

	<h3>Finally, again, this is a virtual currency bot, where lemons hold no monetary value, meaning that it</h3>
	<h3>is indeed okay if someone robbed your lemons because nothing would happen.</h3>
	<div style="margin: 16px;"></div>
	<h3>Plus, there is a command called /deposit, where it deposits your money so that no one can rob</h3>
	<h3>your lemons. This indicates that he has publicly stated that he had over 2000 lemons (this is </h3>
	<h3>considered a lot), meaning he basically said, “Come rob me guys, I have 2000 lemons.”</h3>
	<div style="margin: 16px;"></div>
	<h3>Therefore, this is clearly Yuan Bobo’s fault for not depositing the 2000 lemons that he had.</h3>
	<div style="margin: 16px;"></div>
	<h2 style="margin: 64px;">Response to "The Monketype Incident":</h2>
	<h3>The ‘monkeytype incident’ is when I changed his setting to make it have bright colours, and </h3>
	<h3>‘without permission’ is misleading information. During that time, he asked me if he could have</h3>
	<h3>one of my themes, so I said “Yeah, alright.”, and sent him the link to the theme.</h3>
	<h3>Again, it is not my fault that I had over 5 themes, and he didn’t mention a specific one, which gives</h3>
	<h3>me the right to choose any from my list - and with that, I gave him the bright-coloured one. </h3>
	<div style="margin: 16px;"></div>
	<h3>Furthermore, he has stated that I didn’t change his settings after the theme, and it is not my fault</h3>
	<h3>for denying his request - I have the right to object to his request, as:</h3>
	<h4>1. I already helped: I accommodated Yuan Bobo’s original request of changing his theme, without specifying a specific theme.</h4>
	<h4>2. It is not my responsibility: As I have not agreed to change back your settings after the use, it’s not my obligation to do so.</h4>

	<h2 style="margin: 64px;">Response to "The Discord Spam Message Incident":</h2>
	<h3>The "Discord Spam Message Incident" is when I spammed Yuan Bobo in DMs, using a Python &</h3>
	<h3>Applescript program. He argued that I spammed him in the middle of the night without proper evidence again.</h3>
	<h3>Plus, he has stated that I use a bot & a script to spam him, and just to clarify, this is not a bot, it’s </h3>
	<h3>an alt account created for spamming purposes, which first proves that this is not a bot, as a script,</h3>
	<h3>and a Discord bot are two different things.</h3>
	<div style="margin: 16px;"></div>
	<h3>+ Kieran has stated that he could've just used DND ("Do Not Disturb Mode"), when he was getting spammed,</h3>
	<h3>or could've blocked me (like he said); which implies that he has neglected his phone from being message bombed.</h3>
	<div style="margin: 16px;"></div>
	<h3>It's like leaving your iPhone 16 Pro Max outside on the road on purpose, letting it get run over by a car,</h3>
	<h3>and telling the judge that he purposely ran over it, when you're the one who left it there on purpose.</h3>

	<h2>Postamble</h2>
	<h4>“A gentleman’s revenge can wait ten years!!! James, although I didn’t hack your computer to delete your evidence, I can make a webpage to mock you.”</h4>
	<h5 style="margin-top:-16px;">Quote from “Yuan Bobo”, in his misleading website without even a single evidence.</h5>
	<h3>“A gentleman’s revenge was just destroyed by me - two hours after the release of the revenge;</h3>
	<h3>I hope to see more of those ‘non-evidence-based’ arguments in the next ten years.</h3>
	<div style="margin: 16px;"></div>
	<h3>I could've leaked your address here, Bobo. You should be thankful fr 💀</h3>

	<div style="margin: 64px;"></div>
	<h3>(not) Sincerly,</h3>
	<h3>James Park.</h3>

	<h4>(This is not a joke)</h4>
